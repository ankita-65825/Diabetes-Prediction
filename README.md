Diabetes Prediction Project Using SVM



The Diabetes Prediction project leverages Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful machine learning algorithm, to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients. The primary objective is to build a robust predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and implementing early interventions. This project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment of the predictive model.
